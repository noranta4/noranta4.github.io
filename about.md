I started my PhD in AI at the Sapienza University of Rome, CS department in late 2019. I work in the [GLADIA](https://gladia.di.uniroma1.it/) research group advised by [Emanuele Rodol√†](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-EH4wBYAAAAJ&hl=en).


**What makes us humans?**
My personal search for an answer today is focused on the fundamental nature of knowledge and what makes learning possible. My current research interests include two great challenges of deep learning, namely the data/computation bottlenecks and the generalization gaps. Today my best bet to solve these challenges involves including natural language in the neural pipeline.
